#Platformer Game

This is my current project that I will do a little bit of work on everyday. Im not sure where this game will go but I plan on "finishing" this game. My ambition with this game is to create a platformer where the player movement is very fluid, just like Ori's movement. (It's my favourite platformer game). If I can create a smaller platformer game simialr in size to 1 of Ori section of the map. I will be happy with that.
